# SCS Final Project

This project belongs to the course of **Security in Computer Systems**, which is part of the 3rd semester of MSc in Robot Systems, University of Southern Denmark.

To see the detailed report of the project, go to the repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/CVH95/Havana/wiki).

## Project Description.

The project consists on doing penetration testing in a REST server that controls the activity of a production workcell.  The server that it is going to be used is a version of the one provided in the course _”Robot System Design”_. It is a REST server connected to a SQL database, which stores the production orders and data generated while monitoring the state of the workcell at each moment. It will be set up in a Raspberry Pi in order to attack it remotely. Some examples of what things can be tried out are:

 - Denial of Service attacks: Interrupting the work flow.
 - Injection: Modifying and introducing erroneous data to disrupt the production.
